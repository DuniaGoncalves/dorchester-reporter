## How It's Made:


**Tech used:** HTML & CSS


Creating this site I took the HTML skills I learned and Know I had to add CSS to it to make it look like a newspaper. I took a day it two of constantly breaking it to finally get the look. 


## Lessons Learned:


Patience is key and not being afraid to try different methods and approaches. I learned how to use float to get my articles in columns.
